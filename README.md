# Moberlinity

Moberlinity simulates a carsharing environment in a city. Random places, citizens and vehicles scattered around an area of a city are generated and in the course of two hours of a given time of a day a probable activity can be observed. 

## How to use it

Clone this repository or download it as .zip files and open the `index.html` file.

To adapt the area in which the citizens, places and vehicles are generated, hover the central marker and scroll up to increase the area or down to decrease it. 

To change the location, just click wherever on the map and the central marker will update.

To start a simulation just click on the button located in the bottom-right corner. 

## Remarks

Currently, the time scala used is 1000:1, meaning that a second is being represented as a millisecond, to avoid long running scripts that over an hour go.
